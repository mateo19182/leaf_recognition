# Leaf recognition
***
## Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leaf-classification/overview
***
## Important:
bounding box: height / wide, 
number of leaf pixels / number of bounding box pixels ,
center of mass compare with total bounding box,
number of silhouette leaf pixels / number of bounding box pixels
***
### TODO:
- [x] Bounding box 
- [ ] Center of mass
- [x] Number of white and black pixels
- [ ] silhouette number of pixels 
- [ ] Process files and create a .data (check example.data)
- [ ] Rna - WIP
- [ ] auxiliar functinos - WIP
***
### Future:
1. change files names, better meaningful 
2. featute: pixels intensity (?)
