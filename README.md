***
## Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leaf-classification/overview
***
## Important:
bounding box: height / wide, 
number of leaf pixels / number of bounding box pixels ,
center of mass compare with total bounding box,
number of silhouette leaf pixels / number of bounding box pixels
***
### TODO 1ST APPROACH:
- [x] Bounding box 
- [ ] Center of mass (M)
- [x] Number of white and black pixels
- [x] silhouette number of pixels  
- [ ] Process files and create a .data (check example.data) WIP (B)
- [ ] Rna - WIP(P)
- [ ] auxiliar functinos - WIP(P)
- [ ] SVM - WIP (M)
- [ ] KNN - Wip (I)
- [ ] DECISSION TREES - WIP (G)

- [ ] FINISH MEMORY
***
### Future:
1. change files names, better meaningful 
2. featute: pixels intensity (?) (2ND APPROach)
3. More classes (NEW APPROACH)
4. Symmetry X/Y
